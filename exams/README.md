# Past POCS Exams

POCS has gone through multiple versions.
In some years, we had midterms and finals; in other years there was only one exam or test.
The material covered by POCS has also changed over time.

We provide below some of the exams/tests used in the past, but they should be perused with care, because their relevance to the current edition of POCS can vary significantly.
